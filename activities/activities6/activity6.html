<p class="pcard">Japanese Cherry blossom or sakura are cherry trees, Prunus serrulata, and their blossoms. The fruit comes from a different species. Cherry trees are a symbol of spring for Japanese people. The word Sakura can also be used as a name for women. The traditional custom of Hanami or Flower viewing involves visiting places where sakura are blooming. Japanese people love cherry blossoms, but they are not the national flower in Japan. </p>
